First, we import the necessary libraries for our data visualization project. Then, we define the port to which the Arduino is connected, setting a baud rate of 9600 bits per second to establish communication.

Using the matplotlib library, we create a canvas or window where the plot will be displayed. We initialize a subplot with a 1x1 grid configuration. To store the incoming data points, we create two empty lists: Xdata and Ydata, which will hold the x and y coordinates respectively.

Next, we define a function named update that takes a single argument frame. Inside this function, a line of data is read from the serial port. Since the data from the Arduino is received as a byte string, we decode it using UTF-8 encoding to convert it into a regular string. The strip() method is then used to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the decoded string, ensuring clean data.

To ensure that the line is not empty, we use an if condition. The distance data received is usually in string format, so it is converted to a float to be plotted accurately. This distance value is appended to Ydata, representing the y-coordinates. Simultaneously, the length of Ydata is used to generate corresponding x-coordinates, which are appended to Xdata. This results in an incremental x-value with each new data point.

Finally, using matplotlib, we plot the distance data on the graph. This process creates a dynamic and real-time visualization of the data being received from the Arduino, providing immediate feedback on the sensor readings.
